Hello! I'm a person on the internet that does things, such as:
- Music
- Programming
- Mathematics
- Physics
- Linguistics
- Thinking about stuff
And if you're here to do one of these things, I guarantee you're in the right place!

* [[file:journal/index.org][Journal]]
If you're interested, you can read my [[file:journal/index.org][journal]]. Note that this journal is not my
entire personal life but instead will be a focus on interesting things that I
think of or things that are of a technical nature.
* [[file:blog/index.org][Blog]]
My blog contains many longer writings that do not fit into the mindmap format, and some
of my writings on some of the projects that I've done.
* [[file:mindmap/index.org][Mindmap]]
I also have a mindmap, for those of you who are interested in knowing everything.
** What is a mindmap?
Click the hyperlink to find out! In case you didn't see:
- [[file:mindmap/index.org][Mindmap]]
- [[file:mindmap/index.org][Mindmap]]
- [[file:mindmap/index.org][Mindmap]]
* [[file:config/index.org][Configurations]]
Most of my configurations/dotfiles for various programs are literate configurations, and I
can therefore publish them. So I did! Configurations include:
- EMacs
- Elfeed
- Qutebrowser
…and many more!
* [[https://github.com/ret2pop][Projects]]
My programming projects can be found on my github; other projects that do not directly pertain
to my projects on github or need a more in-depth explanation are explained further in my blog.
I also have a [[https://git.nullring.xyz][personal git server]] for those interested.
* [[https://youtube.com/@ret2pop][Music and Media]]
Most of the music that I have recorded can be found on my Youtube channel. Note that it will also
contain other things that I filmed.
* [[file:about.org][About]]
Who is the man behind ret2pop? How do you contact him? So many mysteries await…

** About this Website
I wrote this website in org mode. For more information, see the [[file:README.org][README]]. Here is how I upload my
website:
#+begin_src shell :exports code :results silent
git add .
rsync -azvP --chmod="Du=rwx,Dg=rx,Do=rx,Fu=rw,Fg=r,Fo=r" ~/website_html/ root@nullring.xyz:/usr/share/nginx/ret2pop/
#+end_src
Then I run magit after.
* Donate
If you like anything that I do, donate! But [[file:blog/crypto.org][should you use cryptocurrency]]? Should
it be used as a means of exchange? Probably not, but it's cool and free for me to do so here you go:
** XMR
An anonymous form of ecash, the only one out of these that is actually being used for the purpose
of currency (on the dark web):
[[./img/monero.png]]
#+begin_example

#+end_example
** ETH (And associated tokens)
Utility in the form of smart contracts (which are perhaps useful for something important in the future),
with first mover advantage in this regard:
[[./img/eth.png]]
#+begin_example
0x135Ed80afB7Cd06E494e5Bb737Da8D4B23153480
#+end_example
Note that this includes subprojects such as LINK which I find to have some value.
** BTC
The standard, and probably will continue to be used as a prediction market/speculative asset for the
efficacy of other cryptocurrencies:
[[./img/bitcoin.png]]
#+begin_example
bc1qaymk2ky8unwq7jdydjw6y9a5xr9z60mkds9ttq
#+end_example
Note that all of the above cryptocurrencies I believe are either potentially useful for some niche, or have
value because of their de-facto link to other currencies that are useful for some niche.
** Do I advocate for using these as currencies?
Only Monero; maybe they can become better than fiat, but that algorithm that keeps them stable does
not really exist yet. Ethereum has some interesting usecases such as with DeFi.
