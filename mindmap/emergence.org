* Emergence systems areâ€¦
Existent in many forms and at many levels. They are the fundamental building
block of everything that exists, I argue, and nothing in this theory of
everything will contradict this statement!

** What is Emergence?
Emergence can be broadly defined as a system whose components organize themselves
into a larger structure via simpler rules that each component follows.

Entire systems such as [[id:a6bc601a-7910-44bb-afd5-dffa5bc869b1][mathematics]] can be explained in terms of a couple axioms,
where all the theorems arising from those axioms are emergent from those axioms.
At least, that is a relatively simple explanation, and does not capture the full
beauty of emergent systems. Therefore, I call apoun an example from daily life:

*** Societies
At every scale, societies exhibit properties of emergence. For example, families
and small communities comprise small areas of town, which comprise cities,
which then make up provinces, and finally countries. In this particular example,
we self organize into self-similar [[id:8f265f93-e5fd-4150-a845-a60ab7063164][recursive]] hierarchies. This is for a good reason;
in order for societies to scale, there need to be abstractions. Each level in the
hierarchy conveys more but less exact information, until we get to the national
level which deals the most with aggregates.

*** Markets Emergent
To use a particular hierarchy example, markets are emergent from barter in goods.
