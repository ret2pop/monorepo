I think it's important to see some of the good in people. For example:
- J.A.: to think about the greater good and their purpose in the world around them in relation to themselves.
- K.S.: to never create abstractions one can't ground in the reality around them.
- A.T.: to consider others and to adapt quickly to new situations and lessons.
- A.S.: to be critical by default.
- H.C.: to put deep thought into analyzing the motivations and character of others, and to be responsible to oneself by developing routine.
- M.H.: to recognize dirty work is the most efficient option in most circumstances.
- myself: to make holistic decisions based on information available, and to collect information, make models, and to try rather than give up.
