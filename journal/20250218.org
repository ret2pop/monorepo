Right now, I am in Victoria in Howard's room with Marissa. It is
pretty fun, and I highly recommend this experience. I think I would
rate it a 7 out of 10.

That being said, I am cognitively tired and I just realized that I
don't have to work on NixOS forever. I made a PR to NixOS for some
packages, and I'll probably fix some of the flake system to allow for
using an ipfs gateway for a fallback mirror.
