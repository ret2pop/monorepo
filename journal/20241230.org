Today I decided to journal again, which is always a rare sight. Right now I'm with Howard at the VPL
main branch, and I'm looking at org-roam-ui while trying to figure out if I can realistically
publish it on my webpage. Additionally, I'm trying to make it more effortless for me to publish my
website, despite how easy it currently is, and I'm investigating if there's more I can publish
automatically with org-mode. I can convert markdown files to org files using pandoc, so I am
actually never having to use markdown for anything, and I can ensure that articles I write in
markdown can be published to my website in org mode.
