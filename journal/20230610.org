Today, I am with my friends, one of which wants to view my emacs configuration.
Also, I got publishing working with emacs, and everything exports to an
html file. Addtionally, I set things up such that org journal uses the .org
extension which allows publishing to recognize these files.

Everything is integrated with emacs. All is emacs.

I'm almost done writing this website. Basically, all I need to do is write a couple
of shell scripts that insert the entire contents of a particular directory to an
html file. Also, I need to find suitable css in order to math this website, and I
need to add a back button using pretty much the same technique.
