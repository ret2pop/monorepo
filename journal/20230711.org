I haven't written a blog post in a while, pain. Basically, recently I have
been doing not a whole lot because of mood problems revolving around sleep.
There are a few things that I want to try working towards, and a lot of them
are internally motivating, but my physical and mental condition is kind of catching up
to me.

I have gotten evil-mode in mu4e to work because before it did not in doom emacs.
I am always very tired for some reason and I have no idea why I am tired.
I guess i could try coffee as a motivator, and that usually works. I think I need
to exercise more.
