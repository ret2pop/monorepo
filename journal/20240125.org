I did not sleep that well, but that is okay for today. I am currently testing how publishing code blocks works. Sounds
silly because it works out of the box, but trust me, there are some weird interactions.

I feel quite sleepy, but I've done a lot of my agenda already. I'll be seeing Kaili today which is nice. I am thinking
of blog posts that I could possibly add, but I can't think of anything right now. Maybe some excuse to use reproducible
research in org mode.
