By the way, my system timezone is not accurate and I just noticed that this is affecting
my journal times, so I am going to fix that.

Today, I plan to do some more mechanics, specifically stuff relating to angular momentum
and lagrangian mechanics. I hope to learn more about quantum mechanics theory, so I think
this is a good starting point.

Also, I would like to learn some general relativity. Although I know the general idea, the
differential geometry part of it is still hard, so I need to study some of that.
