This agenda is a public list of things that I need to keep track of. This is public because
I also keep a private version, and if anyone wants to know what I'm up to or the status of a certain
project, it can be referenced here.

* Tasks
These are general life tasks that I need to do, which don't depend on a specific time or date.
** TODO [#A] ToughNix
I need to work on my monorepo flake which builds all my systems, and should accommodate future
systems and also should be relatively abstractable (i.e. identifiers tied to me should be easily
removed from the flake).
*** TODO [#B] VPS
My VPS needs to be a NixOS configuration.
*** DONE [#A] NixOS Modules
:LOGBOOK:
CLOCK: [2025-01-11 Sat 17:03]--[2025-01-11 Sat 19:35] =>  2:32
:END:
I need to fix my NixOS configuration to not be as monolithic and to be more modular.
*** DONE [#B] Workstation
My NixOS Monorepo needs to incorporate my workstation, and I need to install this config.
*** DONE [#C] Gammastep
Fix gammastep in my config so that it actually works on my dell machine.
*** DONE [#C] monorepo
Merge website and toughnix into monorepo
** TODO [#B] Resume
I need to update my resume with my work experience. Additionally, I want to re-write my resume
in org mode.
** TODO [#B] CSS
I need to update my CSS for my website to look better.
** TODO [#B] Nullring
Update the nullring to be in org mode, and also include a couple more sites.
** TODO [#B] Umami
My client server protocol needs to continue to be written. I also need to make a git repository
for it.
** Music and Media
*** TODO [#B] Write Another Song
I want to write another song.
*** TODO [#B] Make A YouTube Video
I want to start making YouTube videos.
** TODO [#C] Analogue Computer
I want to make an analogue computer.

* Chores
** DONE [#A] Dishes
There will be a TODO when I need to do the dishes.
** DONE Groceries
There will be a TODO when I need to get groceries.

* Scheduled tasks
These are one-time tasks that are scheduled at a particular date, and that don't require regular
schedules.

These are tasks related to seeing my friends. There will be tasks listed here when I schedule
something.
*** DONE Travis and Friends Meetup

general.
