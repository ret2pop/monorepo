* Introducing: the Mindmap
Do you want to know everything like me and be a smart person instead of dumb?
Well, you've come to the right place! üëç

** What is this?
It's a place that hopes to explain *EVERYTHING!!*
** Isn't that unrealistic?
I answer that in my [[file:everything.org][mindmap]]! It has all the answers!
** Doesn't it have to explain itself?
Yeah, we answered that one too. Just read the [[file:everything.org][mindmap]].
** Batteries included?
No, it's a mindmap you fucking idiot.
* Rules
- Don't use the back button on your browser
- Everything here is going to be a link to another mindmap page.
- Therefore, if there is a page you want to go back to, you must navigate until you find a loop back to the original page.
