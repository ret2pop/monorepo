* Introduction
A stack in programming is a data structure that satisfies the following API rules:
1. Push: puts something on the top of the stack
2. Pop: takes item off stack and gives it to the caller
3. Peek: hands copy of top item on the stack to caller
4. isEmpty: checks if the stack size is zero
where stacks generally store their data in a list, either an array or a singly linked list.
