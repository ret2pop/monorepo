It's 3 am and I'm just up with Marissa and doing some small automation
and cleanup tasks. I'm doing these so that I don't really have to
think about them again. I also just saw my friend Erfan at his house,
and we talked a lot about his work and life.
** 13:54 
It's the next day for me practically, and I'm just about to get to
work. Reading my agenda and then I'm going to work on some of these
agenda items today. I might try to get a VPS working with NixOS and
then integrate my server with my DNS domain. I will need to get my
IPFS keys from my server onto my local machine, and then probably set
up the NixOS machine, change the registrar entries and then destroy
the old server.
