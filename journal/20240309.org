Today, I showed some friends around downtown even though they sort of already know downtown decently well.
I used to live in Victoria Downtown so I therefore have a lot to say about the area. Additionally, I am doing
this journal entry on a bus because I am disappointed with my track record of journal entries.

I am pretty much finished my NixOS configuration, but one thing, CJK input, will not work. I assume this is a
problem that can be fixed quite easily, however. Maybe just a wayland issue in particular.

I have started using IRC again recently.
