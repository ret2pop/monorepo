Today, I decided to install NixOS on my machine, and yesterday I got back from Bowen Island to see
Anslie and her friends, while in the process messaging Josh Cindy more (idk if I've mentioned him in my previous journals but if you don't
know I won't elaborate). I went to downtown a couple of times during the process, and it was really fun all around.
