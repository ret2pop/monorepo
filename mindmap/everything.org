* Everything?
This article is about everything. No, really, it is.
Every possible thought you could have is encapsulated
inside a digital copy of my brain.

You can model everything in terms of [[id:1b1a8cff-1d20-4689-8466-ea88411007d7][duality]] and [[id:8f265f93-e5fd-4150-a845-a60ab7063164][recursion]].
There are other ways to model everything as well; for example,
circular structures and self destructing structures. However, these
other frameworks I posit can be explained well with these other
general ones, and for the purpose of saving time in explaining
everything, I'll start with these two things.
** What is the point in explaining everything?
So you can be a god! All knowing! Who wouldn't want that?
** But you have to explain this article in order to explain everything
No I don't. See? I explained this article!
** This is not very coherent
I'd like to see you try.
** Okay, but seriouslyâ€¦
Yeah. I get your complaint. It's a hard task to actually explain everything
and you have to omit details. However, I think this is a pretty reasonable
attempt at doing so and you will soon notice that the frameworks that I
am presenting can in fact be used to explain the article itself, albeit
in a somewhat contradictory way.
** Isn't this just another Framework?
Yes. In fact, I have a page about [[id:6d8c8bcc-58b0-4267-8035-81b3bf753505][frameworks]]!

everything, go here:
