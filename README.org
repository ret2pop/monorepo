* What is this?
It's ret2pop! My website for all things math. Wait, no. Computer science.
Music. Okay, let me try that again.

It's ret2pop! My website for all things.

** Sounds awesome! But why is it written in org instead of html?
Because I have converted to the church of emacs. Remember:
anything and everything that can be rewritten in org, can and should
be rewritten in org.
*** so how did you actually do that?
By using the ~org-publish~ function, ~org-roam~, and ~org-journal~,
as well as writing a lot of things with a literate config.
** So, where is this website of yours located?
https://ret2pop.nullring.xyz, it is the road to enlightenment.
