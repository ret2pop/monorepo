I have dropped my fountain pen and the nib is beyond repair. I will go to the Papery most likely tomorrow, and get a replacement nib, as well as a couple extras if I can afford to. I am with my friends at the beach where I dropped this thing
in a tragic manner. Yesterday, I borked my server and had to start a new one. I don't know how I am going to get the email
server working, but that is the only thing I am missing right now, other than a gitea server. Many losses.
