I've realized that switching themes with my configuration is
really easy because everything is either emacs or my web browser
(or some other third party application that doesn't need a theme
anyway). I'm currently trying out the city lights theme, but I will
probably experiment with more as well.

Today I feel really tired for some reason. Even so, I've been looking
into category theory and group theory. I don't have any physical books
on the two subjects, but I do have online copies.
