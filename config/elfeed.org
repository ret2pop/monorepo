* Feed :elfeed:
This is the feed I use for Elfeed, and the elfeed-org package allows me to publish
them here in an automated fashion. This is why Emacs is so great!
** News :news:
These are the news articles that I subscribe to. Some of these are politics related
but I mostly just want to inform myself about technology subjects.

** YouTube :youtube:
These are YouTube channels that I find interesting enough to keep up with. Note that I keep
up with a variety of thinkers that I may or may not disagree with, but they are nonetheless
the most intellectual version of what their general cohort say:
*** [[https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC1yNl2E66ZzKApQdRuTQ4tw][Sabine Hossenfelder]]
Youtube channel about mostly physics related content (I do not endorse her views on string theory).
*** [[https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC7_gcs09iThXybpVgjHZ_7g][PBS Space Time]]
PBS space time is a channel that discusses various (sometimes cutting edge) topics in Physics in an expert manner.
I find that they are highly accurate, and the host is highly educated in Physics.
*** [[https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCWvq4kcdNI1r1jZKFw9TiUA][ScienceClic]]
ScienceClic is another YouTube channel that does an especially good job at covering cutting edge ideas in physics.
*** [[https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCMxiv15iK_MFayY_3fU9loQ][UnHerd]] :podcast:
UnHerd is one of the best, most interesting political podcasts, period, in my opinion. Though, do note that learning
about politics is kind of pointless.
*** [[https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UC8oZG4c6FzOX4pbdpZBeCPw][Huey Li]]
He's a comedian and kind of a China hater.
