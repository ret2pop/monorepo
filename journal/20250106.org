Today, I'm very tired. I have a couple things that I wanted to do (i.e. update the nullring
webpage), but I'm slow at doing this, and I think I'm going to have to automate it with
Javascript. I'm not having the best day intellectually, but that's okay.

I need to start doing other things soon. Either I will start actually programming, or I will
focus on making more music and media. Either way, I'm sure it will come, and I don't need to
think so much during bad days. My day otherwise wasn't actually that bad. I didn't feel
super terrible, but it's a struggle to be consistent. That being said, I don't think consistency
is the ultimate goal even if I want to be moreso. I just want to make sure I'm working towards
my goals at the end of the day.
