* Introduction
Our current economic and political system isn't totally failing right
now, but it's pretty close. Everyone agrees that our current system
isn't working as well as it once did. Our world leaders are not the
best among us. We live in an era of great technological progress,
while at the same time many of our institutions are /rotting/ -- where
most of our progress is driven by corporate America and Chinese
manufacturing. It is rotting so badly that /Donald Trump/ and /Elon Musk/
are taking over in a semi-coup. This phenomenon isn't just a failure
of governance -- it is a failure of culture.

For decades, we've been taught that culture moves in one, forward
direction, towards progression. But this is a lie. In our worship of
ideology, we fail to replace and examine our incompetent structures
/before/ they fail, and institutional protections are eroded.

The world is collapsing not because of economic cycles or
partisanship, but because we built our institutions on a myth—equality
as a moral good. This myth has led to governments that do not select for competence,
and as a result, our systems are breaking down.
We need to abandon equality-based governance and replace it with a technocratic,
results-driven system that rewards competence above all else. It's
exactly what we need, but keep in mind that Elon Musk is /not/ going to
do this. He recognizes the problem that we all see, but he may not
have the solution.

We do not suffer from:
- a left versus right problem.
- a rich versus poor problem.
We suffer from a competence versus incompetence problem. And we have
failed to replace our institutions before they had a chance to fail on
us. So what do our "best institutions" think of us -- and what should we
think of /them/?

* Inside Harvard
Ivy League schools are some of the best of the best. They promote the
best ideas and they /punish/ bad ones. They punish bad ideas because
everyone in Harvard is /smart/. And these central intellectual
powerhouses will power our future. But is this true? Enter the
mainstream academic thought complex and one of its core values, which
led to revolutions all over the globe: our focus on equality, and the
communist movement which originated in academia
(many famous American physicists were affiliated with CPUSA; the Russian
Communist revolutions started on the back of an intellectual class in
Russia; Chomsky, Deleuze and Guattari; Einstein was a socialist, the
list goes on and on). Let's look at their track record, one of their most prized ideas, and
/let's see how they play out in practice/.
** China
Chinese communism received copious support from Chinese
intellectuals. There were intellectuals in China protesting
for a simpler writing system before Mao implemented the simplified
writing system, for example. However, the movement quickly turned away
from any semblance of intellectual input.

The foremost major failure of Mao's regime during this period was the
great leap forward. During this time, grain was planted densely
because the idea was that grain wouldn't compete against others of the
same kind. This reduced grain harvests, and my friend has a personal
story about this. His grandmother witnessed a farmer telling a commune
that they were stupid for planting grain so thickly, "you could lie
down on it!", they said. They got their tongue cut
off for spreading "false information" about the regime. *Millions starved.*
Other policies included "communal furnaces", where people were told that
they could make high quality metals communally without economies of
scale. The truth is that in order to manufacture high quality steel
instead of pig iron, you need industrial scale furnaces because
"communal furnaces" /can't reach heat capacity/. Despite this obvious
failure waiting to happen and the academics warning Mao of this
possibility, the plan continued. The result? High quality metal,
turned into pig iron.

My grandmother starved and her entire village almost died of
malnutrition. They starved because of bad farming policies, and a
complete inability to automate or move up the abstraction
hierarchy. Mao ordered sparrows to be killed because they were pests
that ate crops. The result?
*The locusts that sparrows preyed on grew enormously in population, and they ate all the produce. Everyone starved.*
But it doesn't matter anyways, because communism is cool. Because an
ideology that created generational trauma for two generations is
/fashionable/. People who have never experienced direct or indirect
influence from this communist regime still have the audacity to
believe this set of failures was caused by the CIA.

After China reverted its socialist policies, it became an economic
powerhouse. The modern day CCP lifted almost a billion people out of
poverty, which is the greatest quality of life improvement in human
history. It is my opinion that the USA attempted to destabilize China
during the Tienanmen Square protests, but this didn't fundamentally
alter China's ability to become capitalistic.
*In spite of possible CIA involvement in destabilizing China, China's new economic policy reflected unforeseen progress*.
What changed in Deng's period? It turns out that /foreign investment/
and /private equity/ doesn't destabilize nations, and capitalism isn't
always a CIA plot. But hey, maybe it's not real socialism. Maybe the
idea is still good and that was just one /really bad/ implementation.
** Cambodia
The Khmer Rouge was one of the deadliest regimes within its lifespan
in human history. They smashed babies' heads in en masse, and they broke
up families on the basis that people should value their /nation/ more
than their families. Within three years, they orchestrated the deaths
of /two million/, making it one of the deadliest three years in history,
reducing the Cambodian population by 25%. Cities were emptied, and
anyone that resisted the regime was executed. It was almost a /fifth/ of
the Nazi regime's total death count, and ran for one /fourth/ of the
time. After Pol Pot's death, none of the leaders were formally tried
for their crimes. The leaders' remaining lives were spent comfortably in
their home country, while American academics such as Chomsky, one of
the most cited public intellectuals in linguistics,
/denied the genocide occured/. The /Nazi/ regime was /de-nazified/ and all their
collective fiction was turned into /pulp/. The Khmer Rouge regime's
leaders were at large until they /died of natural causes/, and their
Western defenders faced no consequences. But hey, maybe... that's just another unlucky instance?
** North Korea
What started as a proxy war in Korea turned into one of the most
brutal modern day regimes. Their propaganda today is a genuine
preservation of cold-war era mentality. So let's look into their
modern day regime, and maybe we can reconstruct what it was like
living in all of these countries.

Their prisons are torture camps, where prisoners catch mice and snakes
to eat because they have /nothing/. Nobody can leave their
country. North Korea's biggest money makers today are in fraud and in
extortion. The people are desperately poor, and the bureaucratic class
are living it large. And let's not forget that there's a natural
experiment that played out in Korea. There's the other side of the
DMZ, where, despite its problems, people have economic freedom and are
happier, despite living in a /dystopian, cyberpunk/ state. Let's not
forget that there's always the other side of the wall. Speaking of which...
** Russia, the Berlin Wall
The first and foremost thing one can look at for quality of life is
people voting with their feet. The Berlin wall wasn't built to prevent
people from getting in; it was to prevent people from escaping. The
West side and East side were split by this wall. On one side,
consumers had all the choice in the world, enormous wealth for the
middle class and even the poor. On the other side, almost /everyone/ was poor.
** Other Regimes
It isn't just in Europe and in Asia that Communism has proven to be a
failed system. It failed in many rogue militant regimes in Africa. It
has failed in south America in Venezuela. Venezuela /should have/ been
rich like the OPEC countries. Instead they nationalized their oil
industry and now they are desperately poor. It failed in Laos. It
failed in Vietnam. It has failed in almost every continent. One of
these failures alone was almost as bad as
the Nazi regime. When failures happen like this, we usually scrap the
idea, not just the practical implementation. Most intellectuals think
that it's only a bad idea in practice, without considering that it
might just be based on /bad principles/.

If communism isn't about centralization and brutal dictatorship,
how come it plays out in the same predictable way, /every time/?
** Economic Calculation
And we know that all these ideas are bad in practice, but what about
in theory? We know, according to modern day neoclassical economics and
public choice theory that Communism as an ideology is /broken/. The
labor theory of value doesn't hold up inasmuch as it doesn't describe
the /subjective/ value placed on goods by individuals, which is the
basis of the original Marxist scientific socialism. We know that
private individuals allocate capital more efficiently than governments
do on average, and nobody denies this simple fact.

Communism is built on a foundation of collective ownership, but also
it is a rejection of the idea that hierarchies in capitalism are
justified. The core tenet of the idea is that /equality/ in economy
ownership is of utmost importance because of dirty capitalist
exploitation. So we see the reason: academia is in a civil war with the
capital owning class, and although they aren't communist anymore, they
share the same principles (/"it's bad in practice but good in theory"/)
-- what if the theory should be scrapped? And how are academics, who
are the smartest people in the world, so /wrong/? What does it say about
these people that the /smartest people/ in the world cling onto this
failed theory? And what does it say that our entire urban society is built
on a milquetoast version of these ideas, after the ideas outright
didn't work?

Communist arguments usually involve pointing out both the exploitation
of the working class by the managerial class, and arguments based on
universal access to public goods. When liberal democracies presuppose
the universal access to goods, they are making the exact same arguments.
The end result is similar. Instead of centrally planning the
production of wheat, you are subsidizing wheat production in order to
guarantee universal access. But this model has the same failure mode:
it just happens in 100 years instead of 10.
* The Stark Reality
Harvard is just as deluded, and our public consciousness is just as
deluded about these ideas as neo-nazis and white nationalists are to
their previous regimes. But at least Nazism only /failed once/. That was
enough for us to learn from our mistakes. What if the smartest people
never learn from their mistakes? What if the ideology that equality is
a universal good -- is actually wrong?

Our society directly /forks/ the same ethical opinions of communists --
while discarding the /theory and application/ of communism in everyday
life. But in my view, the /worst idea in history/ shouldn't be discarded
solely on the practical and the theoretical basis. Imagine if we lived in a
society where everyone thought that /Nazism/ was a good idea in
theory, or that it had ethical ideals. Some attribute this imbalance to the fact that communism was
about equality which is a lot less offensive than explicitly espousing
a genocidal view. However, it's not true on first principles that we
/should/ have a more positive view of equality and a less positive view
of nationalism. Nazis sold their ideas to the nation by using slogans
like "living space" and "restoring our strong nation".
The truth is,
*you can make any ideology sound good if you have a good enough salesman*,
but we don't have to make communism sound good. We were just trained to.
And too often, communism (or its ideas such as equality) don't sound
morally repulsive in the first place because
/people don't sell it that way/. So why do we sell communism as a noble
cause gone wrong, when we sell Nazism as the worst idea in history --
something that isn't remotely true in comparison to Communism?

In my view, academia, and by extension communism, may not have won the
cold war, but it has won the culture war. It won the culture war
because although we may not adopt their application or even Marxist
theory, we adopt their ethical framing of equality as a moral good. We
adopt their framing because we have uncritically looked to these
institutions for guidance historically. We have given them unchecked
cultural power. These people set trends -- and what's in fashion 20
years from now isn't decided in elections. It's decided in a Harvard
thesis today. But this begs the question -- if they're so wrong
about communism, what else could they be so wrong about? If we can't
trust them on the worst idea in history, why must we trust them on
anything at all?

Though, even in our society, we have a sector of unrivaled
economic productivity, making products for people that allow them to
live better lives. But this sector doesn't care about equality. It
doesn't care about anything. Or in other terms, it does care about
people -- as economic units. It cares not who you are, only
/what you can do/. And yet, it treats its subjects better than empathy
can treat its subjects. When /individual/ incentives are aligned with
/collective good/, you can be an /angel/, and a ruthless /investor/. Here,
international criminals thrive. International criminals create
international cooperation. Here, governance is a part of the system,
not adversarial -- we accept a couple of "lobbies" here and there, but
let's just call it a public-private partnership instead! It isn't a
utopia -- but it's /real/.
* The New System
Elon Musk and Donald Trump are capitalizing on the rot of the United
States. What if, instead of propping up this fragile rot in the first
place, we actually designed governance like a systems engineering
problem? Democracy can be optimized -- but as a systems engineering
professional, you know that optimizing something is no use if it can
be /deleted/. Here, we don't value peoples' opinions equally -- we have
a city-state model where /almost every city/ is a SEZ. We optimize
everything in governance, following neoclassical economic principles
and using public choice economics to tell us when we're micromanaging
(when we would cause a government failure). There are no zoning laws,
except in tourist attraction hubs, and the only taxes are land value
taxes, as well as sin taxes and carbon taxes. All wealth
redistribution is done with a negative income tax. Regulations that do
not constantly justify themselves get /removed/. Courts
/manufacture truth/, rather than adhering to preconceived notions of
"fairness" (professional jurors? Betting markets? A system where
voting on the jury means you put up money, so if you're wrong you have
something to lose?). Our police are here to enforce /laws/. Remove all
laws from the books that aren't enforced. Enforce every law on the
books equally and with /zero tolerance/. Riots and violent social upsets are not
tolerated here. Crime and gang violence is treated as domestic
terrorism. Harming public infrastructure development and private capital is
strictly forbidden. Climate activists blocking pipeline development
would simply not be required -- our economists and climate researchers
have already priced that in with a carbon tax. Sorry, but if you're
going to keep blocking this pipeline, we're going to remove you. /Forcibly/.
Freedom of speech doesn't give you a mandate to destroy taxpayer-funded infrastructure.

In this new regime, the old regime's staff can be reused -- if they
can prove their worth. They get rehired in central bank positions, and
in governmental planning positions, but they get paid in call options of a standard
basket of local companies, meaning they get performance pay. In this
new regime, we replace ideas of democracy and equality (including
democratic voting, in say, courts) with ideas that /work/. If a
philosophy is truly shown to work, we optimize it to its logical
conclusion.

** The Efficiency Doctrine
The world isn’t held together by sentiment. It’s held together by
incentives. Governments, corporations, and institutions can preach
about fairness, justice, and equality all they want, but at the end of
the day, none of these ideas survive unless they align with reality.
And reality is governed by efficiency.

Every major human rights movement that succeeded -- whether it was civil rights,
women’s suffrage, or LGBTQ rights -- didn’t win because it was morally
right in some abstract sense. It won because it became economically
impossible to ignore. The same businesses that once refused service to
black customers now fight for diversity. The same corporations that
once wouldn’t hire women now push for gender parity. The same
industries that once ignored LGBTQ rights now celebrate Pride Month with
corporate sponsorships. Not because they cared, but because it made sense.

You can moralize all you want about what’s right, but the world runs
on what works. And when something works, you don’t need to force it.
It wins on its own. Progressives spend so much time trying to
manufacture empathy that they fail to ask whether their solutions are
actually efficient. Do LGBTQ rights need to be forced onto businesses,
or do they emerge naturally because an inclusive workforce is more
productive? Does it make sense to give away land to Indigenous groups
based on historical guilt, or does it make more sense to integrate
them into the economy with productive incentives?

A system that forces people to care is a system that doesn’t trust
efficiency to do its job. If your worldview depends on mandating
compassion, then maybe it was never that compassionate to begin
with. The truth is, the most compassionate thing you can do in such a
situation is to tell them the truth -- that you don't care about them
at all.

The great irony is that when efficiency is maximized, humanism
emerges as a side effect. A prosperous, innovative society needs
people who are educated, mentally stable, and free to explore their
talents. It needs diversity -- not because of some ideological quota,
but because different backgrounds provide different solutions. It
needs to reduce discrimination -- not because of sentimental morality,
but because a workforce that hires the best talent regardless of
gender, race, or identity is simply better at producing results.

If we get rid of the false god of “equality” and replace it with a
system that selects for results, we don’t become less human. We become
more human -- because caring for people is no longer a top-down
directive. It becomes the inevitable consequence of doing things right.

The best part? Most humans want to be compassionate anyways, when
they're not constantly forced to. They'll give every excuse to
themselves to be compassionate to you, if they
like you, even if they're convinced they're doing it for self
interest. At the end of the day, every efficient system is comprised
of feeling human beings. And at the end of the day, what's the more
compassionate system? The one that tells you it doesn't care about you
when it does, or the one that tells you that it cares about you -- and
then doesn't?
** The Road Forward
A future built on competence won't come from Elon or Trump. It
doesn't start with hostile takeovers of the current government. It
first starts with a collective disillusionment with the current
cultural narratives around equality by spreading awareness, paired
with a /new/ belief -- the belief in a deep /Deng style/ practicality.
And it starts from the ground level -- treating people as individuals
instead of as ideological symbols in a cultural battleground, and a deep
commitment towards enriching those around you. Activism in its modern
form often replaces real solutions with performative change.
Instead of walking into this progressive trap, we should aim to create
a culture where our best business leaders, workers, and investors are
recognized and rewarded for their contributions to greater economic and
technological progress.
* Conclusion of the Technocratic Manifesto
The death of our modern day system is a result of /rot/ -- it is the
result of a system that is predicated on the myth of equality. Elon
Musk and Trump are profiteers, they are not builders. They profit more
off of /gutting/ the current system than from accelerating the
efficiency and progress of the private sector. What if we got rid of
this myth of equality -- and started over again, without replacing the
old, taking our understanding from our past failures -- and finally,
as humanity, acknowledge the great losses and tragedy of these
Communist regimes whose leaders /never/ faced consequences?
