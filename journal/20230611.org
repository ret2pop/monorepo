Today, I am going to work more on the website. First of all,
I have to work more on the mindmap. Second, I have to work on
the css, and third, I have to generate the links in a way
that is non-hacky. Probably with a shell script.

I also need to write some LaTeX for the mindmap.

I will also make a github repository for this website, probably,
which means I'm going to make a README.org.

I made the repository and everything. Now, all I need to do is finish
a couple of mindmap articles so that it becomes a cohesive experience.
The website also still needs a favicon and I might want to add some
of my music to it.
