Basically, I got my mechanical keyboard, a laptop stand, and
my wacom drawing thing. It's pretty cozy here.

Yesterday, I did a little bit of drawing in perspective. I am not
currently good at drawing, but i am starting by just doing the basics
of perspective and I will attempt landscapes in the future.

This keyboard has blue switches. I could not even find that much information
on the keyboard online, but it is an hp k23. I do not even know if it is good,
but it can be made good because the switches are hot-swappable.

Anyway, I do like the keyboard a lot, and in the future, I plan to do more
drawing.
