* What is this?
It's ret2pop! My website for all things math. Wait, no. Computer science.
Music. Okay, let me try that again. Is this even a website?

It's ret2pop, a wholistic experience powered by NixOS and Emacs.
** so how did you actually do that?
By using the ~org-publish~ function, ~org-roam~, and ~org-journal~,
as well as writing a lot of things with a literate config. To see more, see my
[[file:config/emacs.org][emacs configuration]] and my [[file:nix.org][NixOS configuration]].
** So, where is this website of yours located?
https://ret2pop.nullring.xyz, it is the road to enlightenment.
* Wait, so where are your dotfiles?
To use my dotfiles, download the ISO image for the installer, log in, and run:
#+begin_src bash
  nmtui
  git clone https://git.nullring.xyz/monorepo.git
  # use vim to change whatever nix files you want
  nix_installer
#+end_src
That's it! If you want to install with all the default settings (look at them first), just run:
#+begin_src bash
  nix_installer
#+end_src
and it will work for you.
