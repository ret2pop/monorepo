* My Literate Configs
If you're reading this, you're most likely on github.
If you are: what are you doing on github when you can go
on the best website, https://ret2pop.nullring.xyz, instead?
Anyway, I use programs that have configurations that allow
for flexibility, and that is therefore what you will see here.
