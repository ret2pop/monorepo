* Introducing ret2pop
Hello! I'm a person on the internet that does things, such as:
- Music
- Programming
- Mathematics
- Physics
- Thinking
And if you're here to do one of these things, I guarantee you're in the right place!
** [[file:journal/index.org][Journal]]
If you're interested, you can read my [[file:journal/index.org][journal]]. Note that this journal is not my
entire personal life but instead will be a focus on interesting things that I
think of or things that are of a technical nature.
** [[file:mindmap/index.org][Mindmap]]
I also have a mindmap, for those of you who are interested in knowing everything.

Most of my configurations/dotfiles for various programs are literate configurations, and I
can therefore publish them. So I did! Configurations include:

- QTile
- QuteBrowser
- Elfeed
â€¦and many more!
