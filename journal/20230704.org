I haven't done a journal entry for a while, but there are a couple
of things that are pretty cool and new. I've fixed all my emacs
config internal bugs, and so the only thing left to do in order
to make my emacs config perfect is try to do everything in emacs.
EXWM already sort of achieves this goal, but I want to open the least
amount of x window buffers as possible as well. Therefore, I've started
using eww more, and it is actually good. Additionally, I've started
using GNU Info more and the documentation is actually really good.

I've also been experimenting with eshell. It feels highly integrated
because of how you can use shell functions as well as lisp functions
all in one REPL.
