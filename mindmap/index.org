* Introducing: the Mindmap
Do you want to know everything like me and be a smart person instead of dumb?
Well, you've come to the right place! üëç
* [[file:../graph_view/index.html][Graph View]]
Everyone should experience the graph view of the wonderful *mindmap!!!!!*
** What is this?
It's a place that hopes to explain *EVERYTHING!!*
** Isn't that unrealistic?
I answer that in my [[file:everything.org][mindmap]]! It has all the answers!
** Doesn't it have to explain itself?
Yeah, we answered that one too. Just read the [[file:everything.org][mindmap]].
** Batteries included?
No, it's a mindmap you fucking idiot.
* Rules
- Don't use the back button on your browser
- Everything here is going to be a link to another mindmap page.
- Therefore, if there is a page you want to go back to, you must navigate until you find a loop back to the original page.
** Prerequisites
One must have an open mind, know the basics of the [[https://nullring.xyz/blog/stem.html][Stem programming language]], and have finished a high school mathematics
education. One must also know about some mathematical notation, though much of it will be explained in the articles.
** What Happens if I don't Follow the Rules?
You're ruining your own fun I guess. These are just the recommended settings
and if you want to change them then you're free to.

That won't stop me from stalking you and physically threatening you, though. Teehee!
* How did you make it?
This section of the website was made with ~org-roam~, an emacs package that allows
you to make a web of notes, something close to a wiki.

* I want to Break the Rules
No you don't. That being said, if you really want the list of all articles, here you go:
