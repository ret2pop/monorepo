This agenda is a public list of things that I need to keep track of. This is public because
I also keep a private version, and if anyone wants to know what I'm up to or the status of a certain
project, it can be referenced here.

* Tasks
These are general life tasks that I need to do, which don't depend on a specific time or date.
** TODO [#B] NixOS VPS Migration
Migrate all my services to NixOS.
** TODO [#B] Nullring
Update the nullring to be in org mode, and also include a couple more sites.
** TODO [#B] Umami
My client server protocol needs to continue to be written. I also need to make a git repository
for it.
** Music and Media
*** TODO [#B] Write Another Song
I want to write another song.
*** TODO [#B] Make A YouTube Video
I want to start making YouTube videos.
** TODO [#C] Analogue Computer
I want to make an analogue computer.

* Academic
** TODO Statistics
** TODO QFT

* Scheduled tasks
These are one-time tasks that are scheduled at a particular date, and that don't require regular
schedules.
** TODO [#A] Clean House
I need to clean my house very soon.
** Friends
These are tasks related to seeing my friends. There will be tasks listed here when I schedule
something.

These are some habits I want to track. They are repeated according to a calendar schedule in
general.
