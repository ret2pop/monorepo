* Introduction
A limit in mathematics is a tool used to describe the intuitive process
of a value or a set of values tending towards another. First, we will define
limits as they pertain to sequences, and then we will define them on [[id:b1f9aa55-5f1e-4865-8118-43e5e5dc7752][functions]].
For a sequence $\{s_{n}\}$:

\begin{align*}
\lim s_{n} = s \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N , n > N \implies | s_{n} - s | < \epsilon
\end{align*}

What this means is that at some point in the sequence, for some choice of epsilon, no matter how small
it is, there has to be an index where every term after that index is closer to $s$ than epsilon. If
some single number $s$ and sequence $\{s_{n}\}$ fulfills this criteria, then it is said that the limit
of the sequence is $s$. Generally speaking, we use the set $\mathbb{R} \cup \{ -\infty, +\infty \}$, where there is a natural
ordering:

\begin{align*}
\forall a \in \mathbb{R}, - \infty < a < +\infty
\end{align*}
defined. Note that we can define equivalence relations on these symbols, but algebra reamins undefined.
** Limits on Monotone Sequences
An increasing sequence is a sequence $\{s_{n}\}$ defined such that:
\begin{align*}
\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \forall m \in \mathbb{N}, n \ge m \implies s_{n} \ge s_{m}.
\end{align*}
and now we wish to prove that the limit of monotone sequences always exist.

\begin{align*}
\lim s_{n} = s \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists N, n > N \implies | s_{n} - s | < \epsilon \\
\end{align*}
