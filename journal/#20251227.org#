I'm journaling again, again after a long time of not doing so. I'm doing measure theory right now. I've been doing so for
a while now.

Speaking to myself,
in format x86 ELF.
pop EBX, ret,
zipping together concepts with a bra-ket.

Transforming abstract into specifics,
Unified by laws of physics,
Under the governance of the divine,
Every theorem working men define.

Designing a universal grammar,
Everything a nail for the all-seeing hammer.
On the tallest mountain, at the highest vantage,
Speaking the ultimate connective language.

Of the highest category,
It's all just one story,
In what some call the book,
In which nobody's proof had been mistook.

The book pages reversed,
And now begins the ultimate search,
Though the content is already there,
As all co-things come in pairs.

Expanding concepts apart like an outer product,
call, push EBX,
Listening to myself,
In format x86 ELF.
