* About Me
** whoami?
[[https://preston.nullring.xyz][Preston Pan]]. Although, that is not really important for the enjoyment of ret2pop, and
it is certainly not the focus at all. Ret2pop is a separate entity, controlled only
by the will of Francois. Ret2pop is a relentlessly curious force willing to entertain
ideas that are unconventional and unorthodox; Preston Pan is the individual that tries
to live this out and fails in a somewhat cringy manner.

Some might know me as ret2pop, some as Preston Pan, and others as LiCoO2. Others may know that
I have an ENS domain, at ~ret2pop.eth~.

Here are all the methods you should use to contact me:
*** IRC

*** How Old am I?
born in 12/23/2005, but does it really matter?
** Keys
This is for all my public keys that are important. Note: for cryptocurrency public keys, see
[[file:index.org][the index]] page with all my addresses. Use either your own self hosted scanner, or another
public scanner to get my public keys.
