I'm currently done reading my entire probability theory book. I'm
deciding what to do now, because of course I want to learn some GR and
some measure theory as well as some real analysis, but I think I'm
better off doing something else right now with my time. Either
figuring out how to run my own Ethereum node or otherwise would
probably be a good idea.
