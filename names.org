* Introduction
Sol is the name of my life operating system. It is the aggregation of all notable tools that I use
in order to impose both structure and meaning on the world. The completed version may feature a
sailboat along with the tools below. Note that a ton of other stuff is contained within the system,
but they have no names as of yet. With that being said, here are the names:

* Names
- Affinity: My desktop configuration
- Continuity: My laptop configuration
- Spontaneity: My VPS server configuration
- Agility: My nix-on-droid flake
- Curiosity: My robot vacuum
- Ingenuity: My (future) 3d printer
- Vitality: My Aquaponics setup, and the name of the Raspberry Pi Zero2 that powers the system.
- Asimov: My homemade ebike
- Olive: My folding knife
- Blueprint: Bryan Johnson's protocol that I am trying to integrate more of
Note that Asimov will have an amateur radio antenna on it, and perhaps I will also carry a couple of
solar panels, and a tent and other things needed for shelter whenever I need to go bikepacking with
an ebike.
