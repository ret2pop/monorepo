* Why?
I want a place where I can write long form essays about subjects
without being constrained by any particular form, like in the mindmap.
** Why not the Journal, then?
This blog is not going to be for my personal life in any capacity,
technical or otherwise. Think about the blog like a mix between
the wiki format of the mindmap and the journal format.
