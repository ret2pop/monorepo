I've been in China for a day now, and the jetlag got to me so I slept way too early.
Nevertheless, this has been nice so far. I am currently working more on my analytical
mechanics book, and I want to learn some group theory and figure out some lagrangian
mechanics.

I need to work more on the website, specifically the mindmap.
