I am leaving for china today. I tried using guix with my arch linux
system but it was too unstable and I almost broke my system, so I
of course stopped. I may try nix in the future, but for now, I will
try to just keep my current setup where it is.

Just realized that I need to publish things for the website; also, I
may want to have a blog where I write non-mindmap related articles.
I need to get git working with signing with my gpg key as well.
