I'm going back to vancouver today, and I'm showing yet another person my journal.
** 18:36
I am finally returning home from Victoria, and thus, my schedule will continue on. My agenda currenty has a lot of missed habits
but hopefully I will be able to recover.

Okay, apparently the busses are not running very often. This is kind of bad because I need to wait an hour for the next bus to actually come,
and this means I will probably get home at around 00:00.
