* Definition
In programming, inheritance is the adoption of attributes of a child class by that of a parent class.
For instance, in this example:
#+begin_src python :results output both
class Animal:
    def __init__(self, birthday):
        self.weight = weight
        self.birthday = birthday

class Dog(Animal):
    pass
#+end_src
The class ~~Dog~~ will have the same fields as that of animal. In general, you can think of inheritance as
taking on attributes from a node higher in the abstraction hierarchy.
