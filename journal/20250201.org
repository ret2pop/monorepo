I've set up various LLMs on my desktop PC. It's pretty cool that we
consumers can just run this stuff on consumer hardware, and I'm really
looking forward to using these tools more. Deepseek r1 is the model
that everyone is talking about, but I think that phi4 is another great
model right now and seems to be extremely competitive per the weight count.
