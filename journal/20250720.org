I'm almost done real analysis. I'm just reviewing and I'm probably going to take a look
at the chapter on the Riemann-Stieltjes integral. Then I'm going to switch over to complex analysis.
I also skipped a couple of subchapters that I have to go back to now, but that's no big deal, and I'm
going back to them now.
