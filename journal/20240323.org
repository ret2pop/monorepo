I am going to the board game cafe right now with some of my friends, and I might play some piano later as well.
Additionally, project Cognition is being released very soon. I hope people will like it, as it has the potential to
be revolutionary in several ways, ranging from novel ways of runtime parsing to novel tokenization manipulation using
postfix.

In any case, we have a working model for this in a private repository.
