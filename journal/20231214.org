Yesterday I had good conversations with many of my friends; I talked a decent bit about the Null
Philosophy with my dorm friends and I talked about the mindmap with Matthew Hinton. In any case,
I did not really work much on the mindmap yesterday so I believe I will do so today. I also need
to get my advanced license.
